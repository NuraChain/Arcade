# The browser passes — notes for Claude Code

## The browser passes, and the wallet in them

Three things drive a real browser here and they do different jobs. `npm run qa` is the 640-cell
matrix - overflow, 44px hit targets, a `main` landmark, a dirty console - and it is a GATE.
`tools/qa/seal-pass.mjs` is the sealing pass. `tools/qa/regression-pass.mjs` is the third, and every
check in it is one the matrix passes while the product is wrong: a page confidently scrolled to the
top, a thread that says it does not exist while it is still loading, a button that stays spinning
after the server refused, a guest offered a control that destroys their account. Both hand-run
passes need the BUILT server, because that is the one that exercises `mountPages`.

**The wallet in all three is an injected EIP-1193 provider over a hardhat key, and that is a
decision rather than a shortcut.** The signatures are real - `viem` signs, this server verifies them
the way it verifies anybody's - so the whole sign-in round trip, the device attestation and the
sealing are exercised end to end. What is skipped is the extension's own UI.

**Real MetaMask under Playwright does not work here, and the reason is worth writing down so
nobody spends another afternoon on it.** MetaMask 13.x is Manifest V3: its background is a service
worker that idles out, and under automation the content script's next message reports
`Receiving end does not exist`, the inpage stream resets, the page gets
`Extension context invalidated`, and the renderer crashes - so `eth_requestAccounts` rejects and the
app renders "Failed to connect to MetaMask" as though the person had refused. Keeping the worker
warm from outside does not fix it. The obvious escape is an MV2 build, whose background page is
persistent - but Chrome 152 removed MV2 support outright, so it will not load at all. Both doors are
shut. Driving the real extension needs a MetaMask built with LavaMoat scuttling disabled, which is
what Synpress exists to do; it is not something `--load-extension` can reach.

What IS set up, outside this repository at `~/.claude/mcp-browser/`: the extension, a Chrome profile
with the hardhat phrase imported, and a `playwright-metamask` MCP server registered against them.
**All six wallet fixtures are the standard hardhat accounts in order**, so the one phrase
`test test test test test test test test test test test junk` holds every one of them. The order
matters and guessing it wastes a pass - a check that signs in as four of them and reads a privacy
boundary reported a correct result under three wrong names:

| # | handle | address |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `dana.w` | `0xf39Fd6e5…b92266` |
| 1 | `omid.k` | `0x70997970…dc79c8` |
| 2 | `sara.k` | `0x3C44CdDd…4293bc` |
| 3 | `reza.t` | `0x90F79bf6…93b906` |
| 4 | `mina` | `0x15d34AAf…2c6a65` |
| 5 | `leila.a` | `0x9965507d…b0a4dc` |
Two notes for anyone driving that profile by hand: the recovery phrase must be TYPED rather than
filled, because `fill` sets the value without driving MetaMask's own handler and the box never
expands into word fields; and the extension tab must stay OPEN, because closing it invalidates the
content script in every other tab at once.

## The responsive matrix

`npm run qa` drives a real browser over every route at 320–1920, portrait and landscape, in both
languages, and fails on horizontal overflow, a control smaller than 44px under a coarse pointer
(hit-tested with `elementFromPoint`, so an expanded hit area counts), a missing `main` landmark
or a dirty console. Findings land in `tools/qa/out/matrix/report.json` with a screenshot per
failing cell.

**A probe that lands on the island nav counts as the viewport's edge.** The 44px check probes 21px
above and below a small control and wants to hit the control itself; a probe past the viewport edge
already passes, because the control is reachable by scrolling. The phone's bottom nav is an island
floating over the page, and `.page` is padded by `--nav-room` precisely so everything can scroll out
from under it - so a control sitting behind the island at scroll 0 is in the same position as one
below the fold. The matrix's short "landscape" cells (390 wide, 360 tall) put the profile header's
copy chips exactly there, and every one of them failed, on a hit the nav's Games link took. The nav
carries `data-island`, and a probe that hits it passes for any control that is not itself in the
nav, so the nav's own links are still measured.

Point it at whichever half is running: `npm run dev` (vite on 3100, the default) or the built
server (`QA_BASE=http://localhost:<port>`). The server run is the stronger one — it exercises
`mountPages`, the prerendered landing page and the real asset headers, which vite does not.

**Give the built server its own port rather than 3200.** 3200 is the development api's, and other
projects on this machine reach for it too, so `npm start` there fails with `EADDRINUSE` — or worse,
answers 200 from something that is not this product at all, which reads as a passing gate until
somebody looks at the title. `PORT=5300 PUBLIC_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5300 …` and the matching
`QA_BASE` is what recent runs use; `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` has to move with it or the realtime origin gate
refuses every socket and each refusal is one console error the matrix cannot suppress.

Run it against the BUILT server when the result has to be trustworthy. Under `npm run dev` the
conductor restarts the api whenever `dist/` is rewritten — a `npm run build` or `npm test` in
another terminal is enough — and every restart costs the matrix one cell: vite answers the
in-flight `/api/_manifest` with a 502, the page boots without its data, and the header controls
fail the 44px check in their pre-hydration state. Three runs in a row each lost exactly one cell
that way, each time to a different route. The same matrix against `npm start` is 600/600.

It needs the **api** either way, because it signs in for real: the whole challenge round trip as the
`dana.w` wallet fixture — fetch the challenge, sign it, post the signature — and every context is
built from the resulting `storageState`. There is no session key it could write into `localStorage`,
the cookie being HttpOnly, and a matrix run against a database the wallet seed has not touched fails
on the first line rather than touring 640 signed-out pages.

**The matrix is a load generator, not a visitor.** It pulls 600 pages as fast as it can from one
address, so anything metered per IP will refuse it - and now that a page load makes real API
calls, it does. Run it against a server started with `API_RATE_MAX` raised
(`API_RATE_MAX=20000 SERVE_PAGES=true NODE_ENV=production npm start`); the limit is configuration
for exactly this reason, rather than the product shipping a limit shaped around a test. That is why the rate limit is scoped to
`/api` and `/ws` in `backend/src/http/rate-limit.ts` rather than wrapped around the whole handler:
a page load pulls forty static assets, a file served from disk with an ETag costs almost nothing,
and one budget cannot be right for both. Metering the cheap thing at the rate the expensive thing
needs is how a normal visitor ends up taking 429s on their own JavaScript — which is exactly what
the first run of this matrix showed, as 808 console errors and 377 pages that never booted.
